## Reasoning

* [Tree of Thoughts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.10601)

Current shortcoming of LM solving general problems
1. Locally, they do not explore different continuations within a thought process (the branches of the tree)
2. Globally, they do not incorporate any type of planning, lookahead, or backtracking to help evaluate these different
options (the kind of heuristic-guided search that seems characteristic of human problem-solving)

Structure of ToT

1. How to **decompose** the intermediate process into thought steps; 
2. How to **generate** potential thoughts from each state; 
3. How to heuristically **evaluate** states; 
4. What **search** algorithm to use.

Search Algorithm

1. ToT-BFS
2. ToT-DFS

> ToT is like giving GPT-4 a whiteboard 
> and saying “think out loud, explore branches, 
> score them yourself, then pick the best line of reasoning.”
